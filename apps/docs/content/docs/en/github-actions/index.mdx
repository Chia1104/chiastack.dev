  <Card title="Clean PR Cache" href="/docs/github-actions/clean-pr-cache" description="Clean up GitHub Actions caches for a specific PR branch" />

</Cards>

## Using Actions from External Repositories

To use these actions in your own repository, reference them using the `owner/repo/.github/actions/action-name@branch` format:

```yaml
- uses: owner/repo/.github/actions/action-name@branch
```

For example, to use the `clean-pr-cache` action:

```yaml
- uses: chia1104/chiastack.dev/.github/actions/clean-pr-cache@main
```

## Requirements

- GitHub Actions must be enabled in your repository
- For actions that require authentication, ensure you have the necessary tokens configured in your repository secrets
